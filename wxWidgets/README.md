# BTD6VersionSwitcher (wxWidgets)
The wxWidgets version of BTD6VersionSwitcher.

## Platforms
- This version is usable on Windows only, as it's made with Visual Studio. If you're daring and using another OS, you can try porting this version to it, but color me surprised if it actually works.

## Functionality
- Functions the exact same as the Qt version, with a few minor differences in look (because I made the Qt version in one day, on the first day I ever used Qt, and I suck at it, this is how it SHOULD look)
