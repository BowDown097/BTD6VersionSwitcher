# BTD6VersionSwitcher (Qt)
The Qt version of BTD6VersionSwitcher.

## Platforms
- This version is usable on Mac and Linux, and I'll use this with the upcoming Android version if it's possible.

## Functionality
- Functions the exact same as the wxWidgets version, with a few minor differences in look (not because I wanted it to be that way, but because I suck)
